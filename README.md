## Introduction

This is a recipe tracking application designed to be viewed on a mobile device although it can also be viewed on larger screens.
Users can view a list of recipes, favorite recipes, and choose recipes to cook. Users can filter recipes by tag, and can search for recipes based on ingredients or recipe name.

## Demonstration of Application

- Adding a rating system for users to use on recipes they interact with
- Choose to add recipes to cook on specific days of the week and see a calendar displayed with those recipes
- Compare a user's pantry, which contains a list of ingredients, to each recipe, and see if they the right ingredients to make a recipe.
